Can't stand the default themes in Mattermost? No problem.

We understand that real heroes prefer dark mode, but let's be honest â€“ the dark themes in Mattermost leave much to be desired. This specific theme has been adapted from one of the dark themes in Slack. If you're looking for a more visually appealing and reader-friendly default dark theme, this might just fit the bill.

Schema:
```
